# TexTruth-AI-Text-Analyser
### PROBLEM STATEMENT
Develop an AI-powered solution to distinguish between AI-generated and human-authored text while evaluating the quality and sophistication of AI-generated content. Participants must create nuanced algorithms capable of detecting subtle differences in language fluency, coherence, and contextual understanding, advancing content verification tools for enhanced trust and reliability in an AI-driven information landscape

### UNDERSTANDING OF PROBLEM STATEMENT
Here we will try to develop an AI-powered solution to differentiate between AI-generated and human-authored text .
And also assessing the quality and sophistication of AI-generated content.
Thus trying to advance content verification tools for enhanced trust and reliability in an AI-driven information landscape.

### PROPOSED IDEA
* AI-powered website & Chrome extension to identify AI-generated text.
* Analyzes language fluency, coherence, and contextual understanding using NLP.
* Leverages machine learning and transformers (BERT) for text pattern recognition.
* Real-time feedback on text authenticity and quality.
* Support for multiple regional languages.
* User-friendly interface to verify online content trustworthiness.
* Prioritizes transparency: explains factors influencing classification.
* Chrome extension allows for ease of access.
